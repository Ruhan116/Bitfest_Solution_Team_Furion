OMG you guys, I'm so hooked on Alfredo pasta right now. It’s so easy! I just boil some fettuccine for like 8–10 mins (or whatever the package says). While that’s cooking, I melt a bit of butter in a pan, toss in some minced garlic, then add about a cup of heavy cream (milk works if you don’t have cream). Throw in a handful of grated Parmesan—I honestly don’t measure, just eyeball it. Stir it up, add salt & pepper, maybe a sprinkle of parsley if you’re feelin’ fancy. Sometimes I toss in leftover chicken, maybe a cup or two shredded, for extra protein. Let it simmer until it thickens a bit, then dump your cooked pasta in and mix. Takes me 15 minutes tops, and it's so creamy and yummy. My whole fam loves it. #pasta #alfredo #comfortfood
