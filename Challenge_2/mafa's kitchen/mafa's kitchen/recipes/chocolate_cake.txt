Craving chocolate? This easy cake hits the spot. Melt 1 cup butter and 1 cup semisweet chocolate together. In a separate bowl, whisk 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 cup flour, 1 cup cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking powder, and 1/2 tsp salt. Add 1 cup buttermilk and 1 tsp vanilla extract to the melted chocolate. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Pour into a greased and floured 9x13 inch pan. Bake at 350Â°F for 30-35 minutes. Let cool completely before frosting. #chocolate #easycake #bakingfromscratch
