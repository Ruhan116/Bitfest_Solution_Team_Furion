Weekend pancake vibes! Mix 1 cup flour, 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp baking powder, and a pinch of salt in a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk 1 egg, 1 cup milk, and 1 tbsp melted butter. Combine wet and dry ingredients, mix until just combined (don't overmix!). Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat, pour batter onto griddle in circles, and cook until bubbles form and edges are set. Flip and cook until golden brown. Top with syrup, fruit, whipped cream â€“ you name it! #pancakes #breakfastgoals #weekendvibes
