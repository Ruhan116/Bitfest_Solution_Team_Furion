Okay, scrambled egg game strong today. Melt a pat of butter in a nonstick pan, crack in 2-3 eggs, and whisk. Add a splash of milk, a pinch of salt & pepper, and maybe some chopped chives if you're feeling fancy. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until they reach your desired doneness. Serve with toast, avocado, and a side of fruit.
