Steak night! Pat dry your steak, season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat. Sear the steak for 2-3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Let it rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy with roasted potatoes and a side salad. #steaknight #dinnerideas #foodie
