Okay, hear me out: homemade tiramisu. It's easier than you think! Soak ladyfingers in strong coffee. In a separate bowl, whisk together mascarpone cheese, sugar, and a touch of vanilla extract. Layer ladyfingers in a dish, top with mascarpone mixture, and repeat. Dust with cocoa powder. Chill for at least 4 hours before serving. Trust me, it's worth the wait. #tiramisu #dessertgoals #homemade
